# RDA Hackathon on maDMPs #

## Overview ##
We would like to invite you to a hackathon on machine-actionable Data Management Plans (maDMPs).  

The hackathon is open for everyone. As well as software developers we are looking for anyone with an interest in data - no technical knowledge is necessary - you might help with ideas generation, user testing, documentation etc.

The goal is to build integrations and test the common standard for [maDMPs](https://doi.org/10.15497/rda00039 ) that is an official output of the [RDA DMP Common Standards WG](https://www.rd-alliance.org/group/dmp-common-standards-wg/outcomes/rda-dmp-common-standard-machine-actionable-data-management ). Participants of the hackathon will decide which topics to work on,  but the primary goals of the hackathon are:
<ul>
<li> Integration of DMP tools, e.g. exchanging maDMPs between DMP tools
<li> Other integrations, e.g. exchange of maDMPs between other services, such as repositories, funder systems, CRIS, etc.
<li> Development of maDMP examples, e.g. to be later used for testing
<li> Mapping of maDMPs to funder templates, e.g. Science Europe, NSF, etc. 
</ul>

The hackathon will take place on 27-28 May 2020. Registration of teams and topics starts on 20 April. Open presentation of results will take place on 29 May.

## Outline of the hackathon ##

### 1.       Propose topics 
Create [issues](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/hackathon-2020/issues) in this repository describing what you would like to work on, e.g. describe what system you have and how you would like to use maDMPs. Through the open discussion with others, narrow down the scope of a topic to work on during the hackathon. 

### 2.       Communicate ###
Join our slack channel [TODO] to communicate with everyone who is participating in the hackathon. You can communicate later within the groups any way you want. We will use slack for announcements and will use it during the hackathon for quick chats.  

### 3.       Register groups ###
Let us know who is going to work with whom on which topic. Don’t forget to give your group a cool name! Register it by filling out [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12bwx0KbY8BAIh24sJQgl1Grhu_oxkMty6ZvsQQxSZ2k/edit?usp=sharing).

### 4.       Hack! ###
You will have two days to do the hacking! Collaborate within the groups and use provided communication tools to discuss with others. Create issues in the [RDA DMP Common Standard repository](https://github.com/RDA-DMP-Common/RDA-DMP-Common-Standard) when you believe there is a revision to the standard or documentation needed. 

### 5.       Submit ###
Summarise what you managed to create. Provide links to resources, demos, screencasts, etc, by filling out the [shared spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12bwx0KbY8BAIh24sJQgl1Grhu_oxkMty6ZvsQQxSZ2k/edit?usp=sharing).

### 6.       Present ###
Present your result in an online videoconference call on 29th May. Everyone will be free to participate as the viewer.

### 7.       Vote ###
Community will have two weeks to vote for the best and most interesting submissions.
